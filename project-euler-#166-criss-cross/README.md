This problem is a programming version of Problem 166 from projecteuler.net

### A  grid is filled with digits d, `0 <= d <= 9`.

It can be seen that in the grid

`6 3 3 0`

`5 0 4 3`

`0 7 1 4`

`1 2 4 5`

the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12.

#### In how many ways can you fill a 4 x 4 grid with the digits d, `0 <= d <= n` so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?

##### Input Format

One integer is given on first line representing n

##### Constraints

`0 <= n <= 7`

Output Format

Print one integer which is the answer to the problem.

Sample Input 0

1

Sample Output 0

34
